<h1>Introduction<h1>
  
Jenkins is an open-source automation server that automates the repetitive technical tasks involved in the continuous integration and delivery of software. Jenkins is Java-based and can be installed from Ubuntu packages or by downloading and running its web application archive (WAR) file — a collection of files that make up a complete web application to run on a server.

In this, you will install Jenkins by adding its Debian package repository, and using that repository to install the package with apt.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
To follow this, you will need:

- One Ubuntu 18.04/or higher server configured with a non-root sudo user and firewall by following the Ubuntu 18.04 initial server setup guide. We recommend starting with at least 1 GB of RAM. See Choosing the Right Hardware for Masters for guidance in planning the capacity of a production Jenkins installation.
- Java 8 installed, following our guidelines on installing specific versions of OpenJDK on Ubuntu 18.04.
